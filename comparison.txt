I just typed the request "Create a Ping-Pong game using Python" in the chatbox and let them write the program.
They both fulfill all the requirements but Copilot did better than Gemini.
The Gemini one is black and white and won't stop until user quit the program.
The Copilot one has better design with colors and will stop when one of the users get 5 scores.
But the reason may relate to the sequence of using. Copilot read the Gemini's code under the same root and may did some improvement based on that.
